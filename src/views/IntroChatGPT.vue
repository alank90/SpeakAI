                  <p>The first prompt provides a starting point or direction for ChatGPT. The response follows the same tone,
                        context, and style as the prompt. Here are some general rules for writing prompts for ChatGPT-3.5:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                        <li><strong>Start simple</strong> - start with a simple prompt and build on it</li>
                        <li><strong>Call to Action</strong> - start the prompt with an action word like "Write", "Create", or
                              "Summarize" instead of "Can you"</li>
                        <li><strong>Add Context</strong> - add specific and relevant context to the task you want to perform
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Add Expectations</strong> - add clear and direct expectations for the content, like how
                              long it
                              should be and what to include.</li>
                  </ul>

                        <h2>Example</h2>

                        <p>With the following prompt:</p>

                                                                                    - It should be useful

                  <h2>ChatGPT-3.5 Role Prompting</h2>
                  <p>A simple way to add context to a prompt is to assign a role to ChatGPT.For example, your prompt can start
                        with "You are a lawyer" or "You are a Poet", then ask your question</p>

                                    Student: Why should I learn about Prompt Engineering?
                                    Kai: Because Generative AI can really boost your productivity if used correctly, and knowing how to write prompts correctly is the key to helping you use generative AIs.
                                    Student: What will I learn from this tutorial?
                                    Kai: This tutorial gives step-by-step guides on how to write AI prompts to get the best possible results from ChatGPT-3.5. You will learn to understand ChatGPT-3.5's capabilities and write prompts that minimize misinformation and biased results.
                                    Student: That sounds interesting. Can you give me an example of how Prompt Engineering can be used in real-world applications?
                                    Kai: Prompt Engineering can be used in a wide range of applications, such as content creation, customer service, and even scientific research. For example, let's say you're running a content creation platform and want to generate engaging article titles for your writers. Using Prompt Engineering techniques, you can write prompts that will help create article titles that are attention-grabbing and relevant to your readers. Another example is using generative AI to answer customer service inquiries. By writing well-crafted prompts, you can ensure that the AI responses are accurate and helpful, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
